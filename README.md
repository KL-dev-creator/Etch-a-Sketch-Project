Completed project and done the two optional tasks. Code is messy and could potentially be made cleaner by implementing while loops, however, code is still appears to be functional.

Known "feature"
- once you have hovered over a square with the progressively darker mode on, you cannot go over the same square without progressively darker mode on to make the opacity 100% and would beed to be rehovered with progressively darker mode to reach full opacity.
